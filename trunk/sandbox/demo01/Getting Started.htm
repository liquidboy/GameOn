            Visual C++ Nano Server application</h1>
        <p>
            This is a simple C++ template that helps you get started with writing applications
            that run on both Nano Server and other Windows installation options. The template is 
            based on the Win32 console application with the following customizations:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The template shows Intellisense for APIs that are supported on Nano Server</li>
            <li>Red error squiggles are shown for APIs that are not supported on Nano Server</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>
            FAQ
        </h2>
        <h3>
            The API I want to use is not supported on Nano Server. What should I do?</h3>
        <p>
            APIs are not supported on Nano Server either because the underlying feature is also 
            not supported or the API has been superseded by a newer API. In most cases,
            MSDN should offer a recommended substitution. 
        </p>
        <h3>
            Does Nano Server support all platforms (x86/64/arm)?</h3>
        <p>
            No. Nano Server only supports x64. Be sure to set the debug target to x64
            when building for Nano Server. 
        </p>

        <h3>
            How do I deploy the project to a Nano Server machine?</h3>
        <p>
            At this time, automatic deployment of the binaries to a target node is not supported. 
            Manually copy the exe and any dependents to the Nano Server machine.
        </p>

        <h3>
            How do I debug the project on Nano Server?</h3>
        <p> Configure Nano Server for remote debugging
            <ol>
                <li>Copy the remote debugger binaries to the Nano Server machine</li>
                <li>Register and start the remote debugger</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Configure your development environment
            <ol>
                <li>Change the "Debugger to Launch" to Remote Windows Debugger</li>
                <li>Set Remote Server Name, Remote Command, Working Directory to point to the appropriate locations on the target</li>
                <li>Change Authentication type to "Remote with no authentication"</li>
                <li>Set the symbols path and start debugging</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
